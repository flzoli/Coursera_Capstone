########################
### BUSINESS CONTEXT ###
########################

A description of the problem and a discussion of the background:

Segmentation in marketing is a technique used to divide customers or other entities into groups based on attributes such as behaviour or demographics. 
It is useful to identify segments of customers who may respond in a similar way to specific marketing techniques such as email subject lines or display advertisements.
As it gives businesses the ability to tailor marketing messages and timing to generate better response rates and provide improved consumer experiences.

In this project, the definition of a marketing strategy using a machine learning technique requires the development of a customer segment.
The sample dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 8000+ active credit card holders during 6 months. 
The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

The goal of this analysis report is to discover the Customer Segmentation of a bank, by looking through their behavior/profile while using Credit Card. 
Hopefully, I can get a clear segmentation of the customer, so I can deploy effective marketing campaign or sales promotion to the targeted costumer.
